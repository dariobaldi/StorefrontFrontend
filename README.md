# StorefrontFrontend

This is the front end for a basic e-commerce page, created for the Full Stack JavaScript Developer on Udacity.

## Setting-up

This Angular app works in tandem with the Backend coded on the previous course project: https://github.com/dariobaldi/StorefrontBackend .

Once the backend server is up and running on the port 3333, you can install all dependencies with `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. It's important to serve it on port 4200 since the backend CORS configuration accepts connections from that address.

Once connected, you'll find a button on the main page to import all the products to the database (the app imports the template products from the JSON file on the assets folder).
